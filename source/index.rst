FSETools
########

`FSETools` compiles several Fire Safety Engineering helper tools I found useful. `FSETools` is designed for fire and structural engineers to enhance efficiency, accuracy and consistency of the design process. End users (i.e. engineers) are expected to have thorough understanding of the theory behind these tools.

`FSETools` is build based on open source projects `fsetools <https://github.com/fsepy/fsetools>`_ and `SfePrapy <https://github.com/fsepy/sfeprapy>`_. A number of libraries (PyQt5, NumPy, Scipy, Matplotlib etc) are also used to make `FSETools` functional.
