Version
:::::::

Version is displayed at the bottom of the `FSETools`'s main window. It consists of three integers separated by dot :code:`major`.\ :code:`minor`.\ :code:`patch`. Build information is also implemented in-addition to Version which is essentially the date and time when the source code is being compiled. This is primarily used for debugging purposes where multiple Build may present for testing under the same Version.
